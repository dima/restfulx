# When you do file uploads from Flash with File.upload() that, unfortunately generates a new session id,
# which will fail to authenticate if you are using restful-authentication plugin or equivalent.
#
# The following code is a work-around for the Flash bug that prevents file uploader
# from sending correct session_id. Here, we hack the Session#initialize method and force the session_id
# to load from the query string via the request URI.
#
# Based on the code from http://seventytwo.co.uk/posts/making-swfupload-and-rails-work-together
#
